<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a simple Instagram bot created with Python. The purpose of creating this bot is to refresh my programming skills. The truth is, I have been focusing on marketing and completing my master's degree in digital marketing and have not done much programming in the last year. Also, when I was programming for companies as a job, I was mostly using JavaScript and node.js. 

Other Reasons Why:
* Create a tool that I can actually use.
* Create a tool that I could use on other marketing projects.
* challenge my self to be great.

This is not a tutorial copied from online claiming to be my own work. I used my brainpower, time, and effort to create this Instagram bot in Python.

### Built With
Python 3.8.1 was used to create this project along with Selenium.
